This project focuses on building a sales comparison dashboard for two regions using Tableau and the "Sample Superstore" dataset. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, number of orders, number of products, and minimum/maximum sales values.

The dashboard includes:
*An overview of sales across all regions
*A direct comparison between primary and secondary regions
*A detailed analysis of sales performance across product categories

Dashboard Layout:
*Top Section: KPIs and summary tiles for a quick overview of the selected regions
*Middle Section: Comparative visualizations including line charts (sales trends), bar charts (category-wise sales), and heatmaps (geographical distribution)
*Bottom Section: Detailed breakdowns covering profit margins, customer segmentation, and product performance
